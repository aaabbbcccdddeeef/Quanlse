    "Due to the imperfection in the manufacturing process and the needs of practical applications, each superconducting qubit has unique properties such as the qubit frequency, the qubit relaxation times. Therefore, each qubit requires a thorough calibration. By calibration, we perform a series of operations on the qubit and measure its response. Information regarding the qubit's properties can then be obtained, including the qubit frequency, the corresponding $\\pi$ pulse parameters, the qubit relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$. The qubit frequency is the driving frequency of pulse signal to realize single qubit gate. The relaxation times are the duration for which a qubit keeps its information. The longer the relaxation time, the better the quality of the qubit and the longer the time available for operation."

To run a rabi oscillation in Quanlse, we import the function `ampRabi()` from the `calibration` module.

The function then returns a list of amplitudes scanned and a list of corresponding excited state populations.\n",
