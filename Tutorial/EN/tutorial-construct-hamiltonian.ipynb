    "Generally, when modeling a superconducting qubits system, we need to define the system's Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{\\rm sys}$ firstly. The Hamiltonian, as the total energy, can be used to describe the behavior of entire system:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{H}_{\\rm sys} = \\hat{H}_{\\rm drift} + \\hat{H}_{\\rm coup} + \\hat{H}_{\\rm ctrl}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It typically contains three terms - the time-independent drift term describing the individual qubits in the system, the coupling term describing the interaction between qubits, and the time-dependent control term describing the control driving acting on qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the Hamiltonian constructed, we can simulate the evolution of the quantum system by solving Schrödinger equation in the Heisenberg picture and then obtain the time-ordered evolution operator $U(t)$,\n",
