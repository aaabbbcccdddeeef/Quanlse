    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of qubits in superconducting quantum chips continues to increase, quantum crosstalk between qubits will undermine the fidelity of the gate, leading to an increase in the error rate of the results. Researchers have proposed a tunable coupling architecture to implement a high-fidelity two-qubit gate \\[1\\]. This structure is composed of two qubits and a frequency-tunable coupler. As the diagram of the structure shown below, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are qubits, $C$ is a tunable coupler between them and $g_{1c}, g_{2c}$ are the qubit-coupler coupling strength of coupler with $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, respectively. The qubit-qubit direct coupling strength is $g_{12}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![tunable-coupler](figures/tunable-coupler-architectrue.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the classical direct coupling structure, the coupling between qubits can be \"turned on\" or \"turned off\" by adjusting the frequency of the coupler in the tuable coupling structure, thus reducing quantum crosstalk noise. So far tunable coupling structures have been widely used in the design of large superconducting quantum computers \\[2, 3\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "For the two-qubit with coupler architecture, Quanlse provides a wealth of analysis functions. This tutorial will demonstrate how to analyze the $ZZ$ coupling and the cross resonance gate characteristics, and perpare the bell state using this architecture."

    "We have introduced how to use Quanlse to analyze the $ZZ$ coupling and the cross resonance gate characteristics in the two-qubit with coupler architecture, and demonstrated the preparation of the Bell state based on the this architecture. Users can click this link [tutorial-tunable-coupling-architectrue-two-qubit-simulator.ipynb](https://github.com/baidu/Quanlse/blob/main/Tutorial/EN/tutorial-two-qubit-simulator-with-coupler-architecture.ipynb) to jump to the corresponding GitHub page of this Jupyter Notebook document to get the relevant code. We recommend that users use different parameters from this tutorial to analyze the two-qubit architecture with couplers, simulate the realization of two-qubit gates, and develop analysis tools with a broader range of applications."
