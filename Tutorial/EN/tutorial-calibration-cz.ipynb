    "\n",
    "In the previous calibration tutorial, we have introduced the calibration and characterization methods for the single-qubit. In this tutorial, we will introduce the pulse calibration method for the controlled-Z (CZ) gate. In superconducting quantum computing, the CZ gate is a commonly used native two-qubit gate, which is easier to be implemented on the superconducting platform. The basic principle is to tune the eigenfrequency of qubits by adjusting the magnetic flux, so that the $|11\\rangle $ state and the $|20\\rangle$ ($|02\\rangle$) state resonate and undergo avoided crossing, and eventually accumulate the phase of $\\pi$ on the $|11\\rangle$ state. The role of the CZ gate can be understood as that the $|1\\rangle$ state phase of the target qubit increases by $\\pi$ when the control qubit is at the $|1\\rangle$ state. The corresponding matrix of the CZ gate in the two-qubit computational subspace is represented as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "U_{\\rm CZ} = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| \\otimes I + |1\\rangle\\langle1| \\otimes \\hat{\\sigma}^z = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}. \n",

    "### 2. Calibrate the Conditional phase\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we introduce how to calibrate the conditional phase, which is also the most important step to realize the CZ gate. We usually tune the frequency of each energy level through magnetic flux and change the phase of each quantum state $|ij\\rangle$, the corresponding matrix form is as follows:\n",

    "{\\rm CZ}_{\\rm real} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\theta_{ij}$ represents the phase obtained by the quantum state $|ij\\rangle$. To implement the CZ gate, we first need to implement the conditional phase as $\\pi$, that is to say, design the flux control trajectory and make $\\theta_{11}=\\pi$. The method is as follows: first, we apply an $X/2$ gate on the first qubit q0 to prepare it in the superposition state of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$; and simultaneously, apply an $X$ gate or $I$ gate on the second qubit q1 respectively; then, apply flux control to realize $ |11\\rangle$ phase accumulation; finally execute an $X/2$ gate on q0 to change the coordinate representation and display the phase change, as shown in the following figure:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we use the virtual-$Z$ (VZ) gate to achieve the above compensation. The basic principle of the VZ gate is to adjust the phase of the arbitrary wave generator (AWG) to realize the operation similar to the rotation along the $z$-axis.
