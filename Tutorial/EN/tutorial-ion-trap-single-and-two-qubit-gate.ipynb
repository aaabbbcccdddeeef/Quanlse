    "\n",
    "The trapped ion is one of the first physical platforms to realize quantum computing. In recent years, significant progress had been made on the trapped ion quantum control technology. Compared to other quantum hardware platforms such as superconducting quantum computing, trapped ion has several advantages. Firstly, the qubits in trapped-ion are identical particles, which ensure the same qubit frequency. Secondly, the single/two-qubit gates have high fidelity, reaching 99.9999% and 99.9% with coherence time longer than an hour \\[1\\]. Thirdly, benefitted from the Coulomb interactions between trapped ions, qubits can achieve all-to-all connections \\[2\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "In trapped ion, a qubit is a single ion trapped by external binding potential. Individual qubit operation is implemented using additional control fields. Differing from superconducting quantum computing, which usually uses microwave and magnetic flux as the control fields, gates in trapped ion systems are usually implemented by lasers \\[3\\]. We can use a Raman processing to transform the internal state transition as shown in figure(a-b), and realize quantum operations. Users can quickly obtain the laser pulse sequences in trapped ion quantum computing using the Quanlse Trapped Ion."

The Raman laser used in the laboratory usually has property $|E_1|=|E_0|$. In trapped ion quantum control, the laser's parameters can be described by $(E,\\omega,\\phi)$. Usually, restricted to the laser's construction, we fix the frequency $\\omega$ and relative phase $\\Delta\\phi$ at the initial time, and operate the qubits by adjusting the amplitude of laser. On account of the linear relation between amplitude and Rabi frequency, the quantum control parameter we refer to is the Rabi frequency $\\Omega(t)$."

Simultaneously, the Quanlse module has a built-in plotting module, which allows users to visualize the corresponding position of each qubit and pulse sequences of the Mølmer-Sørensen gate easily."

    "\n",
    "Using Quanlse, we can quickly extract the Hamiltonian information of the one-dimensional ion chain, including the ion position, calibration information, the phonon vibration mode, the Lamb-Dicke parameters, and the pulse waveform of the single-qubit gates or the Mølmer-Sørensen gate. Users can follow this link [tutorial-iontrap.ipynb](https://github.com/baidu/Quanlse/blob/main/Tutorial/EN/tutorial-ion-trap-single-and-two-qubit-gate.ipynb) to the corresponding GitHub page of this Jupyter Notebook to download the code above.\n",

    "We encourage users to try different parameters, and explore the further functionalities of the Quanlse Trapped Ion module."
